# Datafest Challenge 2021
Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety Center is interested in discovering and
identifying patterns of drug use, with particular attention paid to identifying misuse. For example, patterns might describe demographic profiles within a given category of drug, or combinations of drugs frequently used across groups of people, or combinations of drugs that frequently appear together. One goal of these data is to predict future drug misuse cases. These profiles might be used to predict future drug misuse cases, or to develop a short questionnaire (10 or fewer questions) that might help physicians predict future misuse.

Data collection method: the data, as presented, represent a weighted random sample from each of several countries. Although weights were provided, we ignored the weights and regarded each sample as a convenience sample.
